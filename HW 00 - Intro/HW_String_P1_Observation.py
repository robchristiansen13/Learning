#This file exists for you to try different things,
#understand how they work and get confident with concepts
#before jumping to doing for score homework.
#As i have mentioned during the class, do the following:
#   1.Read the line with single "#" in front -- this is an instruction.
#   2.What you read will tell you what to do .It is either:
#          a)Uncomment(UC) line that starts with "##"(code line)
#          b)Write(WC) simple code by yourself.
#   3.Once you done, comment the created or uncommented line to keep things neat
#I specifically made it to mirror largely what we cover in the class,
#but to give you an opportunity to try things by yourself.
#Good Luck

#WC: Create string variable "text" with 'abcde' as a value
text = 'abcde'
#UC: check the value
#print(text)
#WC: Create string variable "text2"  with "xyz" as a value

#UC:  check the value
##print(text+text2)
#UC: you can combine string
##print(text+" "+text2)
#WC: Create numerical variable "number" with value of 89, no quotes

#UC: Ð¿check the value
##print(number)
#UC: you can also combine string and text
##print(text+number+" "+text2)
#WC: this will generate an error, to fix it put "number" number in str()
#like so str(number)
#UC: you can also use "smarter" formating with {}
##print("{}{} {}".format(text,number,text2))

#WC: change, cobine and add code for below so console prints Your First Name _space_ Your Last Name
#i.e. "Vlas Lezin"
## name = ""
## lastName = ""
##

# UC: You can also manipulate string to remove various characters
##nameWithSpaces = "   something   "
##print( nameWithSpaces )
# UC: Below removes all of the leading and trailing spaces
##print( nameWithSpaces.strip())
# UC: Below removes all of the leading and trailing "A"
##print( "ABRACADABRA".strip("A") )
# UC: You can also remove chars from only left(leading) or right(trailing)
##print( "    TEXT".rstrip() )
##print( "......TEXT.....".rstrip('.'))
##print( "    TEXT".lstrip() )
##print( "......TEXT.....".lstrip('.'))
#WC: modify the strangeText variable to remove the all of the "<" from it
##strangeText = "<<<<TEXT<<<<<"#code should go here
##print( strangeText )

#UC: you need also to be able to replace text in strings
##text = "This is instructor's code"
#UC: See what it does
##newText = text.replace("instructor","student")
##print( newText )
#UC: You can also use variable, obviously
##std = "student"
##print( text.replace("instructor",std) )
#WC: Create a variable and replace "instructor" from variable "text" with your first name.
#like so This is Vlas's Code
