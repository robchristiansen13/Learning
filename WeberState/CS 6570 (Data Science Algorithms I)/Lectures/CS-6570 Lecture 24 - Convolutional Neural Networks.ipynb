    "\n",
    "In our last two lectures, we used a neural network to learn how to classify hand-written digits - and it did quite well! However, while it's not a trivial problem, it's much, *much* simpler than most computer vision problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for this is the size of the data for each observation. For the hand-written digits, we had a $28 \\times 28$ grid, and each grid had a greyscale score between 0 and 255, which meant 784 inputs per observation. That's not a trivial number, but it's much smaller than the amount of data in a standard digital image. For a standard digital image something like a $200 \\times 200$ grid is much more common, and instead of there being a single greyscale value, there are typically 3 (RGB) color values, which would mean each observation would have about $200 \\times 200 \\times 3 = 120,000$ data points. That's a lot of data, and consequently a lot of weights to learn! With that many weights, convergence can be very slow, and you need *a lot* of data if you want to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what does a convolutional neural network do? It looks for patterns by applying \"convolution filters\" to the images, and then learns to classify the images based upon the information from these filters - which is usually a much smaller amount of information!"

So, instead of trying to learn 10 digits, here we're just learning two characters. Further, let's suppose we've only got a $9 \\times 9$ grid and that each pixel in the grid is a bitmap, which means it's either a $0$ or a $1$. Here we could probably train just a simple perceptron (logistic regression) model and it would do a decent job.\n",

We wouldn't expect to see a hard left-to-right or right-to-left diagonal line on an \"O\", but we'd definitely expect to see one on an \"X\". Even more, we wouldn't expect to see a crossed line on an \"O\", but we'd absolutely expect to find one on an \"X\". Conversely, on an \"O\" we'd expect to see curves and vertical / horizontal lines.\n",

If we only had three Conv2D layers then the $3 \\times 3$ windows in the third layer would only contain information coming from $7 \\times 7$ windows in the initial input. The high-level patterns learned will still be very small with regard to the initial input, which may not be enough to learn what we need to learn. So, why not just put in enough convolution layers to fully shrink down our image? Well, that leads to our second point.\n",

    "* If we only had 3 convolution layers, then the final  feature map would have 712,202 parameters. That's a lot! Unless you have a lot of data, that's way too many parameters, and you'll get intense overfitting. So, those pooling layers help decrease the overall size of your model, which makes it faster to train and more robust (less prone to overfitting). Please note that if we added a bunch more convolution layers, we'd have a ridiculously large number of parameters - much more than every pixel in our training data."
