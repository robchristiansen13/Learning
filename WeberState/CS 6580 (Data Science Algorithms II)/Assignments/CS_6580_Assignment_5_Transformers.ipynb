Order information is inherent to the structure of an RNN, and in its operation the data is given to the model in sequence.  However, for a Transformer network using multi-head attention, the data is given to the model all at once. While this can significantly reduce training time, there is no information about the relative order. This is where positional encoding comes in - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network. The values of these encodings come from these sine and cosine formulas:\n",

        "\n",
        "You can think of the positional encodings broadly as a feature that contains the information about the relative positions of words. The sum of the positional encoding and word embedding is ultimately what is fed into the model. The values of the sine and cosine equations are small enough (between -1 and 1) that when you add the positional encoding to a word embedding, the word embedding is not significantly distorted, and is instead enriched with positional information. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data. Why the $10000$ in the denominator? It's really just a hyperparameter that seems to work well."
