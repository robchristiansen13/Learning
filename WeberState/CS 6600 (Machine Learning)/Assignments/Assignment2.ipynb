        "For this assignment you will need to use the sklearn framework to implement a custom Naive Bayes classifier.  The classifier only needs to handle binary data (both the attributes and the classes).  The attributes will always have a value of 0 or 1.  The class labels will always have a value of 1 or -1.  You can use libraries to help with the data processing, calculations, etc, but you must implement your own Na√Øve Bayes algorithm.  Do not use an existing implementation.  One important implementation detail is that you should convert the probabilities to log probabilities to avoid the number becoming to small to represent as a floating point number.  For example instead of computing P(x|c)P(c) compute log(P(x|c)+log(P(c)). Provide your implementation below."
